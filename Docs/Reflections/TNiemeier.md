# Project Reflections

### Instructions
Each group member needs to create a reflection document. The document should be named like this:
[first initial][last name].md
So for example if Mr. Lemke were in your group, his file would be named `rlemke.md`.

You may organize your reflection folders however you'd like, but below I've provided an example format using markdown (which is what .md files are). You can find more markdown notation [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

More information about what is expected in each reflection is available in the project rubric.
